  The planner block buffer is planned assuming constant acceleration velocity profiles and are
  continuously joined at block junctions as shown above. However, the planner only actively computes
  the block entry speeds for an optimal velocity plan, but does not compute the block internal
  velocity profiles. These velocity profiles are computed ad-hoc as they are executed by the 
  stepper algorithm and consists of only 7 possible types of profiles: cruise-only, cruise-
  deceleration, acceleration-cruise, acceleration-only, deceleration-only, full-trapezoid, and 
  triangle(no cruise).

/* Prepares step segment buffer. Continuously called from main program. 

   The segment buffer is an intermediary buffer interface between the execution of steps
   by the stepper algorithm and the velocity profiles generated by the planner. The stepper
   algorithm only executes steps within the segment buffer and is filled by the main program
   when steps are "checked-out" from the first block in the planner buffer. This keeps the
   step execution and planning optimization processes atomic and protected from each other.
   The number of steps "checked-out" from the planner buffer and the number of segments in
   the segment buffer is sized and computed such that no operation in the main program takes
   longer than the time it takes the stepper algorithm to empty it before refilling it. 
   Currently, the segment buffer conservatively holds roughly up to 40-50 msec of steps.
   NOTE: Computation units are in steps, millimeters, and minutes.

       Compute segment step rate, steps to execute, and apply necessary rate corrections.
       NOTE: Steps are computed by direct scalar conversion of the millimeter distance 
       remaining in the block, rather than incrementally tallying the steps executed per
       segment. This helps in removing floating point round-off issues of several additions. 
       However, since floats have only 7.2 significant digits, long moves with extremely 
       high step counts can exceed the precision of floats, which can lead to lost steps.
       Fortunately, this scenario is highly unlikely and unrealistic in CNC machines
       supported by Grbl (i.e. exceeding 10 meters axis travel at 200 step/mm).
